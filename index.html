            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <P>ðŸ‘‹Â Hi, My name is Oyindamola Boboye,This is a personal landing page created to showcase my journey, my
                passions, and my
                goals. It's a small window into who I am and what I do.</P>
            <h4>Bio</h4>
            <p>My tech journey began two years ago, after completing my NYSC, when I started working as a product
                designer. I have since gained two years of experience in product design, creating user-centered
                solutions and solving real-world problems. Currently, I am pursuing a diploma in cloud engineering at
                Altschool's School of Engineering to gain expertise in building scalable, reliable systems and
                optimizing application performance.
                Beyond work, I have a passion for writing poems that explore deep themes such as hope, friendship, and
                life. I also enjoy drawing, creating stories, and inspiring others to chase their dreams.
                <br> Feel free to explore my page and learn more about me!
